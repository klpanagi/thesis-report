The computations involved in producing an output from an input can be represented by a flow graph: a flow graph is a graph representing a computation, in which each node represents an elementary computation and a value (the result of the computation, applied to the values at the children of that node). Consider the set of computations allowed in each node and possible graph structures and this defines a family of functions. Input nodes have no children. Output nodes have no parents.
